# Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.

You can see how I lived before I met you. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! You are the last hope of the universe. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!

Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Do a flip! __Then we'll go with that data file!__ *Say what?* Yeah, lots of people did.

## We're rescuing ya.

![Yeah]({{ site.url }}/img/bender.jpg)

A true inspiration for the children. Tell them I hate them. Throw her in the brig. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.

1. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.
2. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!
3. No, I'm Santa Claus!

### I'll get my kit!

We're rescuing ya. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

* Now what?
* But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.
* Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!

Why did you bring us here? Ask her how her day was. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Negative, bossy meat creature!

And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! No. We're on the top. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.

You mean while I'm sleeping in it? This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!

Ooh, name it after me! I had more, but you go ahead. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! I never loved you. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!

You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? No argument here. It must be wonderful. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. That's not soon enough! Bender, quit destroying the universe! You're going to do his laundry?

For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! I had more, but you go ahead. I'm a thing. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.

Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Ow, my spirit! And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.

I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?

Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. No, I'm Santa Claus! You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!
