Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

Throw her in the brig. I was having the most wonderful dream. __Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!__ *The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed.* You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.

## When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

Bender, quit destroying the universe! Take me to your leader! Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?

1. Oh God, what have I done?
2. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.

### Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!

There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Professor, make a woman out of me. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.

* Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.
* You can see how I lived before I met you.
* Your best is an idiot!

Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. No! The cat shelter's on to me. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?

But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.

I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.

Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." It's toe-tappingly tragic!

Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Who are you, my warranty?! She also liked to shut up! Kif might! No. We're on the top.

No argument here. Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… I had more, but you go ahead. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid.

It must be wonderful. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?

And when we woke up, we had these bodies. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Guess again.

Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Who are those horrible orange men? I can explain. It's very valuable. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.

Daylight and everything. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.

I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.
