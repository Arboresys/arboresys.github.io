# There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!

I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Soothe us with sweet lies. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.

Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. __But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.__ *Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble.* But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

## Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?

![Yeah]({{ site.url }}/img/bender.jpg)


Your best is an idiot! Why would a robot need to drink? Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. Why would I want to know that?

1. It must be wonderful.
2. It doesn't look so shiny to me.
3. Who are you, my warranty?!

### Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?

I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.

* Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!
* Noooooo!
* Hey, whatcha watching?

Bender?! You stole the atom. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Daddy Bender, we're hungry. You don't know how to do any of those. No, just a regular mistake. Why would I want to know that?

Noooooo! Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Who are those horrible orange men?

Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Guess again. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?

Take me to your leader! It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!

We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. No argument here.

Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?

Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Belligerent and numerous. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.

Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Shut up and take my money! I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhhâ€¦ also, comes with double prize money.

Pansy. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Bender?! You stole the atom. I'll get my kit!

When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! Oh God, what have I done?
